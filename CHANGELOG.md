## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-XX

### Added
- ðŸŽ‰ **Initial release of Quasar autograd engine**
- âœ… **Core tensor operations**: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- âœ… **Automatic differentiation**: Full computational graph with backward pass
- âœ… **Global autograd engine**: Thread-safe Arc<Mutex> architecture
- âœ… **Chain rule support**: Complex gradient computations for deep learning
- âœ… **Memory-aligned operations**: SIMD-optimized tensor storage
- âœ… **Mixed requires_grad support**: Operations between tensors with/without gradients
- âœ… **Comprehensive testing**: 111+ tests covering edge cases
- âœ… **Error handling**: Descriptive error messages and proper Result types
- âœ… **Documentation**: Extensive API docs and examples

### Core Features
- **Tensor API**: PyTorch-like interface with `requires_grad()` and `backward()`
- **Shape system**: Multi-dimensional tensor shapes with validation
- **Memory management**: Aligned memory allocation for SIMD operations
- **Type safety**: Generic over f32 and f64 with TensorElement trait
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: Rust's type system ensures no runtime overhead

### Examples
- `full_backward.rs`: Complete autograd demonstration
- Basic arithmetic operations with gradient tracking
- Chain rule computation: `z = x * x + x`

### Technical Achievements
- **Solved BorrowMutError**: Transitioned from RefCell to global Arc<Mutex> architecture
- **Duplicate prevention**: Smart leaf node registration avoiding computational graph bloat
- **Gradient accumulation**: Proper handling of multiple gradient paths
- **Mixed tensor support**: Operations between tensors with different requires_grad flags

### Performance
- SIMD-aligned memory allocation
- Efficient computational graph traversal
- Minimal allocation overhead in hot paths

### Testing
- 111+ comprehensive tests
- Edge case coverage
- Performance regression prevention
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Development Notes

### Version 0.1.0 Development Journey

This initial release represents a significant engineering effort to build a production-quality autograd engine from scratch in Rust. Key challenges overcome:

1. **Borrow Checker Battles**: Multiple iterations to find the right ownership model
2. **Computational Graph Design**: Balancing performance with correctness
3. **Memory Management**: SIMD-aligned allocations without sacrificing safety
4. **API Design**: Creating a PyTorch-like interface that feels natural in Rust

### Future Roadmap

See [README.md](README.md) for detailed roadmap including Python integration, GPU acceleration, and advanced ML primitives.
