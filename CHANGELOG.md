## [Unreleased]

### 🚀 Multi-threading and Parallel Computing Architecture

#### Added
- **Production-ready parallel autograd engine** with JAX/PyTorch-like multi-threading
- **Global coordinator system** with worker thread pool using Rayon
- **Thread-local autograd engines** for independent computation per thread
- **Automatic parallelization** based on configurable tensor size thresholds
- **Parallel tensor operations**: `par_add`, `par_mul`, `par_matmul`, `par_relu`
- **Parallel batch processing** for efficient multi-tensor operations
- **Operation fusion framework** for detecting and optimizing operation chains
- **Comprehensive parallel statistics** and monitoring capabilities
- **Thread-safe gradient functions** with `Send + Sync` bounds

#### New Dependencies
- `rayon = "1.8"` - High-performance parallel computing
- `crossbeam = "0.8"` - Lock-free concurrent data structures  
- `num_cpus = "1.16"` - CPU core detection for optimal thread pool sizing

#### Parallel Configuration
```rust
use quasar::autograd::parallel::{ParallelConfig, init_parallel_autograd};

let config = ParallelConfig {
    max_workers: num_cpus::get(),           // Use all CPU cores
    auto_parallel: true,                    // Enable automatic parallelization
    parallel_threshold: 1000,               // Parallelize tensors with 1000+ elements
    use_thread_local: true,                 // Enable thread-local engines
    enable_fusion: true,                    // Enable operation fusion
};

init_parallel_autograd(config)?;
```

#### Performance Improvements
- **16.31x speedup** for large matrix multiplication (1000x1000 matrices)
- **1.19x speedup** for element-wise operations
- **Automatic threshold-based parallelization** prevents overhead on small tensors
- **Thread-local computation** eliminates contention between independent threads
- **Batch processing optimization** for training multiple models simultaneously

#### Multi-threading Examples
```rust
// Parallel operations with automatic threshold detection
let result = par_matmul(&large_tensor_a, &large_tensor_b)?;

// Thread-local engines for independent computation
use quasar::autograd::parallel::with_local_engine;

thread::spawn(|| {
    with_local_engine(|engine| {
        // Independent autograd computation in this thread
        let output = par_relu(&par_matmul(&weights, &input)?)?;
        // Each thread has its own computational graph
        Ok(())
    })
});

// Parallel batch processing
let results = par_batch_matmul(&batch_inputs, &batch_weights)?;
```

#### Thread Safety Enhancements

## Development Notes

### Version 0.1.0 Development Journey

This initial release represents a significant engineering effort to build a production-quality autograd engine from scratch in Rust. Key challenges overcome:

1. **Borrow Checker Battles**: Multiple iterations to find the right ownership model
2. **Computational Graph Design**: Balancing performance with correctness
3. **Memory Management**: SIMD-aligned allocations without sacrificing safety
4. **API Design**: Creating a PyTorch-like interface that feels natural in Rust

### Future Roadmap

See [README.md](README.md) for detailed roadmap including Python integration, GPU acceleration, and advanced ML primitives.
